Last time:
- Decision procedures for automata and grammars

!DFA , !NFA , &DFA , &'DFA , !CFG , &CFG  are decidable
!TM is T-recognizable

Today:  (Sipser §4.2)
- !TM is undecidable
- The diagonalization method
- !TM is T-unrecognizable
- The reducibility method
- Other undecidable languages

Recall:  Acceptance Problem for TMs

Let  !TM = { &, (  | & is a TM and & accepts (}

Today’s Theorem:  !TM is not decidable

Proof uses the diagonalization method,
so we will introduce that first.

The Size of Infinity

How to compare the relative sizes of infinite sets?

Cantor (~1890s) had the following idea.

Defn:  Say that set ! and " have the same size if there is
a one-to-one and onto function #: ! → "
Range (#) = "
“surjective”

& ≠ ( →
#  &  ≠ #  (
“injective”

We call such an # a 1-1 correspondence

Informally, two sets have the same size if we can pair up their members.

This definition works for finite sets.

Apply it to infinite sets too.

Defn:  A set is countable if it is finite
or it has the same size as ℕ.
Both ℤ and ℚ" are countable.

ℝ is Uncountable – Diagonalization

Let ℝ = all real numbers (expressible by infinite decimal expansion)

Theorem:  ℝ is uncountable
Proof by contradiction via diagonalization:  Assume ℝ is countable

So there is a 1-1 correspondence #: ℕ → ℝ

Diagonalization

Demonstrate a number + ∈ ℝ that is missing from the list.

7 ≠4 ≠0 ≠

+ = 0.8516182…

differs from the ' th  number in the ' th digit
so cannot be the ' th number for any '.
Hence + is not paired with any '.  It is missing from the list.
Therefore # is not a 1-1 correspondence.

ℝ is Uncountable – Corollaries

Let ℒ = all languages

Corollary 1:  ℒ  is uncountable
Proof:  There’s a 1-1 correspondence from ℒ to ℝ so they are the same size.

Observation:  Σ∗  = {', 0,1,00,01,10,11,000, … } is countable.

Let ℳ = all Turing machines
Observation:  ℳ is countable.
Because  . . is a TM} ⊆ Σ∗ .

Corollary 2:  Some language is not decidable.
Because there are more languages than TMs.

We will show some specific language 0TM is not decidable.

!TM is undecidable

Recall  !TM = { &, ( | & is a TM and & accepts (}

Theorem:  !TM is not decidable
Proof by contradiction:  Assume some TM + decides !TM.

So + on  &, (  = ,

Accept  if & accepts (
Reject
if not

Use + to construct TM -
- = “On input 〈&〉

1. Simulate + on input 〈&, & 〉
2. Accept if  + rejects.  Reject if + accepts.”

- accepts 〈&〉  iff  & doesn’t accept &  .
- accepts 〈-〉  iff  - doesn’t accept - .
Contradiction.

Why is this proof a diagonalization?

Check-in 8.2
Recall the Queue Automaton (QA) defined in Pset 2.
It is similar to a PDA except that it is deterministic
and it has a queue instead of a stack.
Let !QA =  {  &, (  | & is a QA and & accepts (}

Is !QA decidable?

(a)  Yes, because QA are similar to PDA and !PDA is decidable.
(b)  No, because “yes” would contradict results we now know.

(c)  We don’t have enough information to answer this question.

!TM  is T-unrecognizable

Theorem:  If ! and ! are T-recognizable then ! is decidable
Proof:  Let TM $% and $& recognize ! and !.
Construct TM ' deciding !.

' = “On input )

1.  Run $% and $& on ) in parallel until one accepts.
2.   If $% accepts then accept.
If $& accepts then reject.”

Corollary:  !TM  is T-unrecognizable
Proof:  !TM  is T-recognizable but also undecidable

Check-in 8.3

can we prove for the class of T-recognizable languages?

The Reducibility Method

Use our knowledge that !TM is undecidable to show other
problems are undecidable.

Defn:  $!%&TM =  (, *  ( halts on input *}

Theorem:  $!%&TM is undecidable
Proof by contradiction, showing that !TM is reducible to $!%&TM:
Assume that $!%&TM is decidable and show that !TM is decidable (false!).
Let TM , decide $!%&TM.
Construct TM - deciding !TM.
- = “On input  (, *

1.  Use , to test if ( on * halts.  If not, reject.
2.  Simulate ( on * until it halts (as guaranteed by ,).
3.  If ( has accepted then accept.
If ( has rejected then reject.

TM - decides !TM, a contradiction.  Therefore $!%&TM is undecidable.

Quick review of today

1.  Showed that ℕ and ℝ are not the same size
to introduce the Diagonalization Method.

2.  #TM is undecidable.

3.
